### [Codefellows: Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

Graphs are non linear data structures that have:

- Vertices: nodes
- Edges: connection between nodes
- Neighbor: adjacent nodes (connected via an edge)
- Degree: the number of edges connected to a vertex

**Undirected Graphs** have undirected or bidirectional edges (meaning they are doubly linked edges)

**Directed Graphs** also called a **Digraph** where each edge has a direction (can be doubly linked but can also be singly linked)

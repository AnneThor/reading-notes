Ok, today I will review some blogs about tech.

## [The Code I'm Still Ashamed of -Bill Sourour](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

What a strange article (from 2016 no less). It was so trite that I am not sure if I believe it is true or not. I understand why this man feels culpable, but it seems like a long chain of irresponsible behavior that ends with a teenaged man writing some code he didn't understand the reach of. So, one would think that would rather be on the company he was employed by at the time and back to the medical industry in general. But in general, I think it is more or less clear when you are interviewing what the motives of your employer will be.

## [Will Democracy Survive AI -Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

This article is from 2017 and some of these things seem like they already happened (digital recognition use in Xin-jiang springs to mind). I always think it is interesting that automation is viewed as a bad thing, as if the human dream was to work until they died. The real problem here is the structure of society. If we were able to meaningfully automate most work so that humans could ... work less, then theoretically everyone could benefit from this. But since we have a society where all gains are siphoned off to a small percentage of elite people, this will not be realized. It's easier to take a tail wag the dog approach to this issue, but actually we are in control of the way our society is shaped and we will probably have to accept some significant shift in that for automation, etc. to be a positive thing. Everyone would be better off if the internet went back to a science sharing platform for nerds instead of the horrid swamp of selfies filling up servers that are probably having a deleterious effect on the local climates where they are set up.

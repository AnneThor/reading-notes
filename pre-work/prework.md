## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

Commonly observed mistake is trying to code before understanding the full solution implementation.

### Steps to approach a problem

1. Read the problem twice
2. Solve manually with 3 sets of sample data
    - Mathematical induction (solve for 1, 2, n) works well
    - Look for edge cases

3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write the manual steps in pseudo code
5. Replace with real code
    - Will be easy if prior steps properly done

6. Optimize the real code
    - Using well named variables is an assist here

Balance of the time is spent on the planning portion, steps 1-3

### Must know items for each language you test in--

- List creation
- List/Array sort
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list or dictionary
- Parse strings 
- Convert types

If a problem is very large, consider cutting it in half and solving them in pieces; the split can be where you think solving the problem would be simplified if you were given a certain piece of information.

I actually read this before it was behind a paywall, and now I cannot revisit to take notes, but the takeaway is to involve only in what you find relevant/interesting and not waste too much time on roadblocks. A typical pithy Medium article.

### Steps to effective problem-solving

1. Understand the problem

    - 'If you can't understand something in simple terms, you don't understand it -Feynman'

2. Plan your solution by answering: 'Given an input, what is necessary to return the expected output?'
3. Break into sub problems and connect the dots
4. How to approach getting stuck

    - Debug (meaning go through solution step by step)
    - Reassess, consider abstracting to a different general approach
    - Do some research, look for similar solutions

5. Practice

## [Five Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

Point is to find underlying cause of a problem; go and examine rather than solve the problem you think is happening.

Ask 'why' five times in order to trace the problem back to the root cause.

- Answers should be rooted in fact to allow a path of deductive reasoning
- Keep asking why until you get to the logical conclusion
- Counter measures should be apparent by this point
- Remember to monitor your measures and record their efficacy

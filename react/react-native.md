## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

Redux toolkit is more concise and creates your action events automatically and gives you the ability to write syntax as if you are directly mutating state (although you are still not doing that under the hood). Redux "Ducks" force you to use more biolerplate to dispatch actions and to write code that explicitly returns no mutated state.

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

Less boilerplate code which leans to more clarity and makes the system easier to understand.

## Vocabulary Terms

Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Redux Toolkit Slices | Analogous to a reducer file in the redux store; slices are the logic and functions to control one piece of state (a piece here just meaning a group of 1+ related state variables)
Namespace | A namespace is a region that dictates scope to the identifiers; All things within a common namespace (without any privacy modifiers) should have access to functions/variables within that namespace

### [Introduction](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

Views are building block of UI, can be nested, represent blocks on the UI

You can start to build the app with React Native Core Components (those are ready to use native components)
